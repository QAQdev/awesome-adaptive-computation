**Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts, Jacobs et al (1991)**. [pdf](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/jjnh91.pdf)

- Here collaborative, learned Mixture of Experts approaches to handle subsets of the training set are proposed. It's remarkable how close current approaches are to the original gating network. They also show intuitive expert specialisation on the task of vowel discrimination.
